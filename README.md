JungGraphMeasures - PageRank and HITS implementations for large RDF graphs 

This projects uses JUNG â€” the Java Universal Network/Graph Framework to compute PageRank and HITS scores. 
Jung is a software library that provides a common and extendible language for the modeling, analysis, and 
visualization of data that can be represented as a graph or network. It includes implementations of a number of algorithms
from graph theory, data mining, and social network analysis, such as routines for clustering, decomposition, optimization,
random graph generation, statistical analysis, and calculation of network distances, flows, and 
importance measures (centrality, PageRank, HITS, etc.).

Usage
=================

PageRank and HITS are invoked by
